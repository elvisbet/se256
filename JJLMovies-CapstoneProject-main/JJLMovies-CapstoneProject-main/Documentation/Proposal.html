    <h1><u>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</u></h1>
    <p>
        I am proposing a website that will allow the user to add/edit and view links on articles, pictures, and documents from a genre of choice. The guests are not limited to searching and viewing but will have an option to sign up and get rights to add/edit
        and delete his data In the past decade people have been looking on the internet for answers to simple daily questions and this has been made possible by different search engines. However, one is limited to getting an answer to the question asked,
        my website can help the user to both get the answers and recommendation of similar topic of interest (Grouped in genre)

    </p>
