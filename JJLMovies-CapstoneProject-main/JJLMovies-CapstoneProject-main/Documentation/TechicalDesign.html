    <h1>JJL Films</h1>
    <h1>Technical Design</h1>
    <h2>Organization</h2>
    <p>We will be keeping our site organized by keeping everything in separate files, for example having a style file for the site. Along with keeping each specific page of the website into its own folder, just so we all won’t get confused and have code
        where code shouldn’t be. This way when we all work on the project at the same time, we won’t be confused as to what is what. This will let us work together smoothly and efficiently. We will also be organizing the file by their function. For example,
        there will be a front-end file that contains all our html code and a backend file that contains all our scripts for connecting our site to the database.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>File Names</h2>
    <p>blueprint.php - This is not a part of the website itself. This will serve as the blueprint of the nav bar, top bar, and page layout. This will be used to more easily create new web pages by copying the default necessities. style.css - This is the
        file we are storing all of our stylizing for the site. dbConnection.php , dbQuery.php - These two files will serve as our connection to the database with dbConnection serving to connect to it and dbQuery used to query the database with sql commands.

        it’s our home page, our home feed will display recently uploaded movies from users you follow, if you are logged in that is the default page you will be taken to when you type the base site link. ProfilePage.php - This will be the page that displays
        the user profile or another users profile depending on the php session vars that will tell the code to display by UserAccountID
